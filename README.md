**Stop using monolithic config setups, start developing! This Repo will give you a Kick-Start.**

Kick off your project with this boilerplate. This starter ships with the main Gatsby configuration files you might need to get up and running blazing fast with the blazing fast app generator for React as well as ElectronJS.

## :mortar_board: Install

Just use `npm install` or `yarn install`, it's your choice.

## :tada: Usage

To use this boilerplate you'll have to clone this repo and copy the files you need to your new project.
You will find all informations in the files.

- Use: `npm run develop` to start developing.
- Use: `npm run build` to build.

That's it!

***Be aware that both processes use webpack to bundle the electron files before using them. Furthermore if you want to ship your final app, you should look into the `electron-builder` docs.***
